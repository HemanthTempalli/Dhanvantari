- **Symptom-Specialist Mapping**: Uses medical knowledge base to match symptoms with appropriate specialists
- **Confidence Scoring**: Provides confidence levels based on symptom clarity and specificity
- **Multi-Specialty Support**: Covers various medical specialties (Cardiology, Gastroenterology, Dermatology, etc.)

#### **Automated Healthcare Workflow**
1. **Symptom Input**: Patient enters symptoms through chat interface
2. **AI Analysis**: LangChain agents analyze symptoms and ask clarifying questions
3. **Specialist Recommendation**: System recommends appropriate medical specialist
4. **Appointment Booking**: Patient can book consultation with recommended specialist
5. **Telehealth Integration**: Google Meet links generated for video consultations
6. **Follow-up Management**: Email notifications and appointment confirmations

### User Interaction Flow

```
